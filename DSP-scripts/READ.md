# DSP Scripts

This directory contains scripts related to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) that were developed as part of laboratory exercises during my studies at AGH University of Krakow. Each lab consists of several tasks, and each task is focused on a specific concept or technique related to DSP.

## Folder Structure

- **Lab1/**: Contains scripts for tasks completed in Lab 1.
- **Lab2/**: Contains scripts for tasks completed in Lab 2.
- **Lab3/**: Contains scripts for tasks completed in Lab 3.
- ...

Each task corresponds to an individual Python script (`task1.py`, `task2.py`, etc.), with comments and explanations inside the code.

## Task Overview

The tasks generally involve applying various signal processing techniques, such as:

- Fourier Transforms (DFT, FFT)
- Filtering
- Signal analysis and visualization
- Noise removal and data processing

These tasks were completed using libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.
