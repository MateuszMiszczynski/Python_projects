Python Projects :
This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed for learning and showcasing practical skills. It includes both GUI applications and algorithmic implementations.

Projects Overview
1. tkinter-csv-app
A desktop application built using Tkinter, designed for working with CSV files. It allows users to:

Generate synthetic CSV data with customizable entries.

Search & filter records by keyword or gender (female names).

Sort CSV files externally by any column (e.g. name, price) in ascending or descending order.

Useful for practicing GUI design, file I/O, and basic data processing in Python.

2. dsp-labs
A collection of lab exercises and scripts related to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Python. These notebooks and scripts demonstrate concepts such as:

Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

Windowing (Rectangular, Hamming, Blackman, Chebyshev)

Spectrum analysis and visualization

Zero-padding and frequency resolution

Great for reinforcing signal processing theory with practical code.

Requirements
Python 3.x

tkinter (comes with standard Python)

numpy, matplotlib â€“ for DSP plots (optional, used in dsp-labs)

Standard libraries: csv, heapq, os, random, pathlib

Purpose
This repository is intended as a personal learning archive and a showcase of skills in Python programming, including GUI development and signal processing.
