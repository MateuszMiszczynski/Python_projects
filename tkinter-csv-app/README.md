# Tkinter CSV App

Tkinter CSV App is an application that allows you to generate, analyze, and sort data in CSV files. It uses the `tkinter` library to create a graphical user interface and standard Python libraries to handle data and files.

## Features

- **Generate CSV Data**: The application allows you to generate user data in CSV format. You can specify the number of rows, and the data is randomly generated from available names, surnames, delivery methods, and items.
  
- **Search Data**: Users can search data in the CSV file based on keywords and filter data, e.g., by gender (female names).

- **Sort Data**: The application allows you to sort data in the CSV file by the selected column (e.g., first name, last name, item, price) in ascending or descending order.
